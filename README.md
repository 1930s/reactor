# Transatomic Reactor Documentation

Welcome to the main repository for Transatomic's reactor design documents! We're very glad to be open-publishing our work, and we hope it will support a wide range of molten salt reactor research and development efforts. 

The subdirectories are organized as follows: 

<b>IP-filings</b> - Granted patents, applications, and provisional filings. 

<b>blueprints</b> - Balance-of-plant blueprints for the 520 MWe reactor design (TAP-520). (We haven't yet uploaded these files -- we first need to verify they comply with export control guidelines.)

<b>open-questions</b> - A list of technology gaps and other areas of important future research for molten salt reactors. 

<b>tech-reports</b> - Technical reports written as part of our GAIN (Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear) collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, describing the TAP-520 design. 

<b>white-papers</b> - Whitepapers describing the overall design of the TAP-520, the neutronics of the TAP-520, the zirconium hydride moderator, and the TPX microreactor design.
